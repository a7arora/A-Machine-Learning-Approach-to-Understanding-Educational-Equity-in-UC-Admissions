In this project, I explore disparities between academic rigor indicators (such as AP participation and UC eligibility rates) and standardized academic proficiency (measured by SBAC scores) across 100 California public high schools. Using machine learning techniques, I model these discrepancies to identify potential grade inflation and admissions inflation patterns at the school level, with a focus on equity implications for underrepresented student populations.

I use a Random Forest regression model to predict SBAC proficiency percentiles from school-level academic rigor indicators. The residuals from this model serve as a proxy for grade inflation, quantifying how much higher or lower a school's standardized performance is relative to its AP/UC profile. I then apply polynomial regression to model UC Irvine admissions rates from SBAC scores, using the residuals to infer admissions inflation or deflation, capturing cases where schools receive more or fewer admissions than expected based on standardized academic ability.

To assess fairness and potential systemic advantage, I conduct subgroup analyses stratified by socioeconomic indicators such as free/reduced lunch eligibility (FRPM%), English Learner (EL%) rates, and underrepresented minority (URM%) status. These analyses reveal disparities in grade inflation and admissions outcomes across income and demographic groups, suggesting structural inequities in how academic performance translates into college access. Feature importance results from the Random Forest model show that academic rigor and GPA-related proxies contribute almost equally to SBAC predictions (47% vs. 53%).

Finally, I analyze the correlation between inferred grade inflation and admissions inflation and find a negligible negative correlation (r = â€“0.04), suggesting no meaningful linear relationship. This may indicate that UC admissions decisions partially adjust for grade inflation, though no causal inference can be drawn from the data. This project offers a residual-based fairness modeling framework that could support future work in machine learning for educational equity and admissions policy evaluation.
